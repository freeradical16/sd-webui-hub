## How to contribute

- **Reporting bugs**:  
  Please open an [Issue](../../issues) with clear steps to reproduce and logs if possible.

- **Suggesting features**:  
  Open an Issue and label it as a feature request. Describe the problem it solves, not just the feature.

- **Submitting code**:  
  1. Fork the repo
  2. Create a new branch from `main`
  3. Make your changes
  4. Open a Pull Request (PR) against `main`

## Coding guidelines

- Keep Dockerfile and configs minimal and reproducible
- Use pinned versions where possible
- PRs should include an explanation of *why* the change is useful
